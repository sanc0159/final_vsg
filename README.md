Tell us about your process, challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those changes. What have you learned by creating your web portfolio?

I think this class in particular, has taught me how designers have so much more potential if they understand how they can translate their creativity into coding. I had no idea I would be able to code a complete website with my work, that aligns with what I want to showcase. For me, the biggest challenge was to stay true to the vision, understanding what I needed to look for in Bootstrap and how I could modify it to work for my website.
